# Gameshelf

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<h1>GAMESHELF</h1>
An SPA created with React and an as-yet-to-be-determined board game API along with Firebase. The goal is to make an app where you can:
  <ol>
    <li>sign in to your own account</li>
    <li>add board games you own to your personal database of games</li>
    <li>create a "game night" from your board games</li>
      <ol>
        <li>the game night may be a length you select and then use the API to determine average game length to give you games to fill up the time</li>
        <li>will randomly select the game(s) for you, but preferentially choose those that haven't been played yet</li>
        <li>could also tailor the game night for the types of players expected -- hardcore gamers? casual enjoyers? &c.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>allow you to rate and add notes to your personal game database</li>
    <li>potentially allow you to share your game database (or some portion thereof?) with other GameShelf-ians</li>
  </ol>

<h5>EOL!</h5>
