# Gameshelf

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

GAMESHELF -- a SPA created with React and an as-yet-to-be-determined board game API along with Firebase. The goal is to make an app where you can:
  1. sign in to your own account
  2. add board games you own to your personal database of games
  3. create a "game night" from your board games
    3.1. the game night may be a length you select and then use the API to determine average game length to give you games to fill up the time
    3.2. will randomly select the game(s) for you, but preferentially choose those that haven't been played yet
    3.3. could also tailor the game night for the types of players expected -- hardcore gamers? casual enjoyers? &c.
  4. allow you to rate and add notes to your personal game database
  5. potentially allow you to share your game database (or some portion thereof?) with other GameShelf-ians

EOL!
